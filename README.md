# Ruby Intro To Object Relationships: "Belongs To"

## Introduction

So far, we've mainly worked with classes that do not play well with other custom
classes. In other words, we've defined classes that create objects that do not
interact with other objects that we've created. Instead, they have methods that
allow them to operate on themselves, or operate with some of the built-in Ruby
classes. For example, a `Dog` class might have methods that describe an
individual dog's attributes and behaviors.

```ruby
class Dog
  attr_reader :name, :size, :temperament
  def initialize(name, size, temperament)
    @name = name
    @size = size
    @temperament = temperament
  end

  def bark
    if quiet?
      puts "#{name}, the #{size} dog, says rf"
    else
      puts "#{name}, the #{size} dog, says RUFF!"
    end
  end

  def quiet?
    temperament == 'quiet'
  end
end
```

Here we have a class that changes the way a dog barks based on its temperament.
This object isn't capable of interacting with any other dog object though.

In object-oriented programming, however, we write programs that reflect
real-world situations and environments. In the real world, different entities
are related to one another and interact with one another in various ways.
Luckily for us, individual objects in object-oriented Ruby can interact with one
another in ways that reflect that real-world relatedness. In fact, it's hard to
imagine an application without some degree of interaction, or association,
between your classes, or models.

Here are just a few examples:

- Your users sign in to your app and "friend" other users. All of a sudden, users
  are associated through friendship.

- Your app connects users to animal shelters through which they can adopt pets.
  Users are associated with shelters and with pets. At the same time shelters are
  associated with pets.

- Your app allows users to aggregate their most recent tweets and those of their
  friends and followers. In this example, users are associated with tweets and users
  might even be associated with each other.

These are just a few examples of the sorts of domain models you will soon
develop, almost all of which will involve object relations––the idea that
instances of your classes (also referred to as models in such a situation) can
interact with each other and be associated with one another.

In this lesson, we'll be taking a look at one of the most basic ways that two
classes, or models, can be related to one another: the "belongs to"
relationship.

## The "Belongs To" Relationship

Imagine we are creating an app that allows users to list and interact with their
music library. We're used to writing single classes to represent single concepts
in our program. In this application, it makes sense for us to have a class to
represent an individual song. Our `Song` class might look something like this:

```ruby
class Song

  attr_accessor :title

  def initialize(title)
    @title = title
  end
end
```

Now we can create a new song like this:

```ruby
hotline_bling = Song.new("Hotline Bling")
```

And we can return its title to us like this:

```ruby
hotline_bling.title
  # => "Hotline Bling"
```

As far as modeling our program on the real world, however, this isn't very
realistic. Songs have many more attributes than just a title. The most important
of which, from a user's point of view at least, is the song's artist. In the
real world, a song belongs to an artist and an artist owns the many songs he or
she has created. How can we model this relationship through our code? Let's give
individual songs an artist attribute:

```ruby
class Song

  attr_accessor :title, :artist

  def initialize(title)
    @title = title
  end

end
```

Now that we have a setter and getter for a song's artist attribute, we can do this:

```ruby
hotline_bling.artist = "Drake"
hotline_bling.artist
  # => "Drake"
```

Now that a song can have an artist, we might be wondering what other attributes
might be related to songs and artists in this domain model.

For example, users of our music app might want to know some more info about an
individual artist. What albums has Drake created, for example? What about the
genre of Drake's work?

Let's ask him:

```ruby
hotline_bling.artist.genre
  NoMethodError: undefined method `genre` for "Drake":String
```

Uh-oh! Looks like the string, `"Drake"`, that we assigned this song's `artist`
attribute equal to doesn't (shockingly) have a `#genre` method. The
relationship model that we have set up is incomplete. An individual song does
have an artist attribute, but instead of setting it equal to a complex object,
such as an instance of some kind of `Artist` class that we can get more
information from, we've set it equal to a simple string. A string can't tell us
what genre of music it makes, how many albums it has created or anything else
necessary to modeling our music app. This makes sense. The developer of Ruby can
only make building blocks. They can only create general-purpose blocks that we
compose into great creations.

So, instead of setting the `#artist=()` method equal to a string of an artist's
name, let's create an `Artist` class and assign an individual song's artist
attribute equal to an instance of that class.

```ruby
class Artist
  attr_accessor :name, :genre

  def initialize(name, genre)
    @name = name
    @genre = genre
  end

end

drake = Artist.new("Drake", "rap")
hotline_bling = Song.new("Hotline Bling")

hotline_bling.artist = drake
```

Just like we were able to set the artist attribute equal to the string,
`"Drake"`, we can set the attribute equal to an instance of the `Artist` class,
stored in the `drake` local variable.

Now we can ask for the genre of the artist of `hotline_bling`:

```ruby
hotline_bling.artist.genre
  # => "rap"
```

And the name of the artist of `hotline_bling`:

```ruby
hotline_bling.artist.name
  # => "Drake"
```

Now our relationship between songs and their artists is complete. **This is
called the "belongs to" relationship**. A song can only have one artist (at
least in our domain model), so we say that a song "belongs to" an artist. We
enact this relationship by giving songs a setter and a getter method for their
artist. There is nothing that requires that the artist attribute be filled with
an instance of the `Artist` class. This is an internal contract that you must
keep. As the developer, you must make sure that you only put `Artist` instances
in there!
